This is STVM - a stack-based virtual machine, which aims to be fast and lightweight.

STVM is meant to be small, and allows implemententation to extend the *base instruction set* with an *extended instruction set*.

STVM has a (WIP) specification that you'll be able to find here in about 3-4 months.

You'll also be able to find the source of the implementation of STVM I've been working on here soon.
